# Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of ’1' bits it has
# (also known as the Hamming weight).
#
# For example, the 32-bit integer ’11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011,
# so the function should return 3.

class Solution:
    # @param n, an integer
    # @return an integer
    def hammingWeight(self, n):
        result = 0
        while n > 0:
            result, n = result + n % 2, n >> 1
        return result
